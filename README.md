# [FizzBuzz](https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/)

* Write a program that prints one line for each number from 1 to 100 :
  - Usually just print the number itself.
  - For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number
  - For the multiples of five print Buzz instead of the number
  - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz instead of the number

For example, given the numbers from 1 to 15 in order, the function would return:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
